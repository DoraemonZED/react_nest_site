# Development Workflow

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Install dependencies:
   - Frontend: Run `npm install` in the `frontend` directory
   - Backend: Run `npm install` in the `backend` directory

## Development
- Frontend development server: `npm run dev` in `frontend` directory
- Backend development server: `npm run start:dev` in `backend` directory
- Use Docker for consistent development environment

## Code Organization
- Keep related files close together
- Follow the established directory structure
- Create new components in appropriate directories
- Update documentation when adding new features

## Version Control
- Create feature branches from `main`
- Keep commits focused and atomic
- Write descriptive commit messages
- Review code before merging

## Testing
- Write tests for new features
- Run tests before committing
- Ensure all tests pass before merging
- Follow test naming conventions

## Deployment
- Use Docker for containerization
- Follow the deployment checklist
- Test in staging environment first
- Monitor logs after deployment
